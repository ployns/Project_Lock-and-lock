WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   XLXI_31/XLXI_10/XLXI_38/XLXN_141 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_31/XLXI_10/XLXN_109 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_31/XLXN_21 is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXN_109 is sourced by a
